bash - bourne against the shell ---- for linux


Data centers --> servers --> OS --> multi user / networking os
 
why we use shell commands ?
	it is not a GUI it is a shell -- not user friendly

who - adminidtrative privelage command

shell  commands has 2 parameters -- 
		input and parameter

cal 2025 -- give 2025 calendar
cal -3     -- give prior month,present month,next mnth

man - manual 

man cal -- gives all manual commands for cal
cal cmd id appear in 

 cal --help

[[[[]]]] -- indicates optional parameters in Computer science.

man -h -- gives information about command we used 
--help

grep -h ---- WRONG
grep --help --- RIGHT

directory -- logical container contains files

ls -F 	--	list all files and directories

ls -d  */ --	lists only directories

ls -l  -- 	detailed manner of files and directories
		'-' - files
		'd' -  directory
		'l'  -  link file

ls /home/dirname -- show all files present in that location

* what is the first letter denotes in permission file?
	Denotes files types like:
		'-' - files
		'd' -  directory
		'l'  -  link file

~ -- home locations
cd ..  -- prior directory

ls -l directory_path -- lists all files present in that without navigating to that directory

echo -- print the statements

echo 'content' > filename.txt  -- put the content into filename.txt

cat filename.txt  -- gives the content of filename.txt

can be overide the file content using "echo 'content' > filename.txt" 

echo 'content' >> filename.txt -- used to append the content 

cat filename1.txt filename2.txt  --  cat can read the multiple files 

we can create directories in previus directs using ==>  mkdir ../samdir2

mkdir prj{1,2,3,4,5}  -- creates prj1,prj2,prj3,prj4,prj5 directories in the current directory

-R -- recursive --> shown all the files in a directory along with path

touch .hiddenfile --> create a file that is hidden

ls -lt ==> files in order of created time

ls -a ==> shows hidden files also

ls -lh ==> shows all the files in human readable format --> KB,MB,GB data sizes

wild card operators are ::==>
	{}
	[]
	-
	*
	?

ls -l *.txt --> all text files shown

ls -l a*.txt --> all text files starting with a in thier filename

ls -l a*.* --> all files start with a in their file name

ls -d p*/ --> all directory name start with p as directriy name

ls -d prj[1-5] --> shows prj1 prj2 prj3 prj4 prj5

ls -d prj{3,5} --> shows prj3 prj5

ls -d prj?/ --> after prj single character is allowed

> -- io redirectional operator

less filename.txt --> interactive command,page by page moment just like paging in js

more  filename.txt --> interactive command , line by line moment

head -n filename.txt --> give n number lines from the top of the filename.txt

cp src_filename  prj1/  --> cp -copies file content

to copy from the current loc to diff loc

to copy from the current drectory to different file we use --> cs ~/adm3/lx.txt;

mv src destination -- instead of copy it moves from src to destination

mv old_file_name new_file_name  --> used to change the file name 

cp *.* dir_name -- copies all current directory files into dir_name

cp -r * ~/dir_name -- copies all file into dir_name

cd ~/allfiles -- root directiry duplicate

rmdir dir_name -- removes the directory(removes the empty directory only))

**when directory contains dub dirs we cannot remove this dorectory 

rm file_name -- file removing

rm * -- all files removes in the current dirs except dirs

rm -r * -- all files include the sub directories will be removed

rm -ri dir_name -- asks for confirmation for the removal of dir

ln - symbolic link 
link file doesn't have original file - sofr link
link file have original file but the deleltion of original file  doesn't effect on hard link file - hard file

ln file_name hard_link_name -- creates a hard link

ln -s file_name hard_link_name -- creates a soft  link

ps -- show all commands whihc is running in our session

top -- shows all the processes running (previuos user also) and cpu,memory,system statistical information  - CONTINUOSLY RUNNING COMMAND

storage commands -
du - disk usage 
df - disk file system
df -Th -- gives total disk files system
