Instead of doing 1000+ commmands for the daily tasks 

we use shell scripting ---- programming stmt + shell command

windows - api ----> linux - system call

shell scripting ---- we write a set of commands in a shell 

shell scripting -- programming language for OS of UNIX/LINUX

all shell programs need to end with .sh   ---> file_name.sh

we will write the shell programs un vim editor

open vim editor 
	vi pro1.sh

#!/bin/bash
	shebang -- Tell for what type the interpreter shell scripting is written
	it is an optional text

to execute this shell file_name.sh -- sh file_name.sh
